## Mission, Vision and Values

**Mission**: At Kizano's FinTech, you come to learn, lab, grow and evolve. Technology is a growing
space that is constantly evolving. We stay on top of the trends by having associates who just
freshly learned about new softwares releasing new documentation and content all time! Our
decentralized approach makes it easy for you to learn what you need and get affirmation of your
skills faster than a traditional 2 or 4 year degree! We gamify the process to make it more of an
experience. This will keep your attention much more effectively than a traditional hour lecture by
giving hands on activities where you build muscle memory rather than study theory without practical
application.

**Vision**: Kizano's FinTech is designed to give hands on experience in a gamified environment with
community skills validation. Decentralized Federated Education that becomes not just industry
standard, but industry recognized. Let's create a community where we help each other out regardless
of trade, skill or specialty and make learning and teaching fun for everyone!

**Values**:

- Honesty and Authenticity: We don't b/s about anything and are completely upfront about costs,
expectations and plan accordingly.
- Integrity: I do what I say and I mean what I say. I am consistent in my message, values and
execution.
- Communication: If you see something, say something. We speak up about issues because bad news
doesn't get better with time.
- Loyalty: My associates know they will always have a home with me.
- Responsibility: I don't need a babysitter and neither should you. We are all adults here and we
know how to handle our business.
- Innovation: We aim to be first to market with new ideas and helping people find what works for
them!
