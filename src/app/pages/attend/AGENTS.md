# Attend an Event/Class

On this page, the user can register to attend a class event.

This page will use a Cal.com integration to enable users to sign up for events.

Once signed up for an event, they will be given confirmation from cal.com about the event and sent
a meeting invite.

This integration is fully-featured. Just render the `cal.com` component from the utils and it will
take care of the rest.
