## Schedule: Book time with me

## Attend: Subscribe to the next event

## Lecture List Page

The parent component will render the list of lectures, classes recordings and other content
available.

I picked "lecture" because "class" and "event" are either reserved keywords in most
programming languages or already class objects.

## Lecture Detail Page

This is the child to the lecture list page and will render more details and the body of the content
from the lecture list page.
