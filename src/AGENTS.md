# Angular App Config

All Components and pieces under this directory are bare and empty and ready
to be populated with logic and other instructions as described by child `CLAUDE.md`
description files. Please follow subsequent instructions.

This is the angular application entrypoint.

If there are any styles used in more than one component, include them here in
the global `styles.css` to avoid repeating the same instructions in multiple
components and to give a consistent look to the website.

If any colors are needed throughout the site, please use named colors and
only named colors described by the `:root` css element to ensure a consistent
look without inventing new colors. The only exception to this would be the
colors by built-in name: `black` and `white`.

If a custom color is needed for any component, prefer updating the root
`styles.css` to name the color and use that going forward.
